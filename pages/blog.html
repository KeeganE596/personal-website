      <h4 class="work-subtitle">The Raygun</h4>
      <p>I struck some inspiration from somewhere and decided to model a raygun, I sketched up some ideas and then jumped into Maya to model. Iterative changes where made along the way, I didn't really document this but there are some test renders which show a bit of this below, changes are focused around the front 'antenna' end, the fin and the handle additions. I am quite happy with how this turned out and also that I actually finished it, it was good practice for modelling, UVing, texturing and rendering.</p>

      <p>Over the Uni break I started to model the original RYNO from Ratchet and Clank 1, when I finished modelling I UV'dit and have chucked on some basic flat coloured textures and set up a lighting scene using an HDRi and some extra key/fill lights over a flat plane backdrop (lit as well). A couple of renders below and a simple turntable animation.</p>

      <p>Even more glowy things and primitive objects, I am enjoying making these, they are easy to make look good, playing around with the Boss spectral waves in Maya for the orange ones, will make asmall idle animation with the white sphere, just a bobbing, I realise now I could do the same with the orange waves.</p>

      <p>Playing around with lighting/emissive objects and textures using this statue called <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-venus-de-milo-at-louvre-paris-1657">Venus de Milo</a>. I want to work on the statue material some more to get a better texture and specualrity, and I would also like to make the lights beams pop a lot more, they look sort of flat and stuck on, maybe adding glow around the edges on the black would help to fix that.</p>

      <p>I wanted to practice some sculpting so the last few days I jave been working on this skull sculpt. I gathered a bunch of reference and jumped into 3DCoat, I don't really have a good process for scultping something like this, so just working it out as I go. I'm happy with how the main front face of the skull is coming along, the lower jaw still needs a lot of work though.</p>

      <p>Quickly played around with nParticles in Maya, for this scene they are dropping from an emitter and bouncing off a surface below, giving this this freeze frame, suspended look in this render. i like the colour combo and it was a good little lighting practice to.</p>

      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Simple Architecture and Yellow Ball</h4>
      <p>A simple 'architecture' like render, used a basic model, a skybox with an HDRi and an area light with a cool tone on the front of the structure, inspired from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu32V_EHW2L/">@arc4g</a> on instagram. Another quick simple render with a ball on a ramp, with a yellow background, I just thought it looked pretty good. Also played around with the purple liquid scene from yesterday, I tilted the cube structure back a bit so it slowed the liquid flow making it fill each step a lot more and making it look thicker</p>

      <p>Playing around with Bifrost liqud simulations in Maya. A simple staircase of cubes and a liquid emitter at the top, I was trying out different viscosities and how they interacted with the staircase, and playing with materials on the liquid mesh.</p>

      <p>I did a random quick little scene of some cubes on a teal infinty wall backdrop, just an idea I had a while ago and so I decided to quickly bang it out, added some text cause it looked almost producty. I also did a little work on my cast-iron plant scene, just added a couple more leaves and some small touch ups to the models, so not worth a full blog post.</p>

      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Cast-Iron Plant Model</h4>
      <p>I started a new plant model, cause who needs to finish other projects first...Based on the cast-iron plant, a popular indoor variety, I thought it looked pretty cool and not to diffucult to model. I used 3dCoat to get a flat leaf shape, then moved to Maya and used nonlinear deform tools, band and twist to shape the leaves. I alse made a quick spherical planter to stick the leaves in. Hopefully i'll get to texturing the small scene and finishing it off.</p>

      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Monstera Leaf Model</h4>
      <p>It's been a while but here is an update on the Monstera leaf model/textures. I made a quick little scene to put the leaf in with a pot and attached a stalk, on a grey infinty wall background. I set up a couple lights and used an HDR lightdome for better ambient lights. I UVd the leaf in Maya and chucked the model over to Substance Painter to start the texturing process. Following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po6vW9ANmu0&t=1470s">Brent Le Blancs</a> tutorial I finished a first attempt, I am not overly happy with it, it looks pretty fake and I don't have any sub-surface scattering happening yet, but it is a start and the result isn't terrible.</p>

      <p>Working on my Monstera leaf model for a realistic shader scene. I have modelled the leaf flat and think that it is at a good point, I need to create another couple different sized/shaped iterations then curve and add stems to make a large plant together, I might just work on the textures for this one first though to test it out.</p>
